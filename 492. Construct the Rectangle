1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        if (area==0) return new int[2];
        int a = (int) Math.sqrt(area);   // be sure to add (int), otherwise Math.sqrt() will return "double".
        while (area%a!=0) {
            a--;
        }
        int b = area/a;
        return new int[] {b, a};
    }
}
