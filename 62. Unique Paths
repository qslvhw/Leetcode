A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach 
the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?


// dynamic programming. transfer function: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1]. initialize row=0 and col=0 as 1.
public class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i=1; i<m; i++) {
            for (int j=1; j<n; j++) {
                dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];   
    }
}
